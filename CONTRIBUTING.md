## Scripting

#### Custom scripts

Add custom scripts in [./scripts](../scripts). See [example](../scripts/example.coffee) and [official docs][scripting-docs].

[scripting-docs]: https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/scripting.md

#### Third-Party scripts

To find packages, look on [npmjs.com][npmjs] or use `npm search`:

    % npm search hubot-scripts panda
    NAME             DESCRIPTION                        AUTHOR DATE       VERSION KEYWORDS
    hubot-pandapanda a hubot script for panda responses =missu 2014-11-30 0.9.2   hubot hubot-scripts panda
    ...

To add packages:

1. Use `npm install --save` to add the package to `package.json` and install it
2. Add the package name to `external-scripts.json` as a double quoted string

#### hubot-scripts

Before hubot plugin packages were adopted, most plugins were held in the
[hubot-scripts][hubot-scripts] package. Some of these plugins have yet to be
migrated to their own packages. They can still be used but the setup is a bit
different.

To enable scripts from the hubot-scripts package, add the script name with
extension as a double quoted string to the `hubot-scripts.json` file in this
repo.
